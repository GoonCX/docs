##(Go on Continuous Delivery, Monitoring and infrastructure orchestration)

GoonCX is a distributed continuous delivery, deployment, monitoring and orchestration platform hopefully to be built on containers using GoLang.

This repository is for the issues tracking and misc documentation

#Preface
The reason for a new kind of infrastructure orchestration, monitoring and other related activities - is that, we need to install an agent for everything in today's world. So for every kind of system we need its agent on the machine. Then we manage those agents using configuration management tools and then it just becomes way too complicated to handle all these various type of common activities which include CI, Monitoring and alerting, peformance measurement.

#Enter GoonCX
